## About the Project

Unstyled text messes with my chi. I created Presswork as an easy drop-in CSS file to get initial text formatting out of the way in new projects.

### Presswork Is

Presswork is an approximation of designed typography. Under the hood, it's an extended version of Nicolas Gallagher's stellar [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) project.

In addition to browser normalization it also provides sane spacing and layout tweaks to make your text look good'ish. You'll get:

* All the sweetness from normalize.css, plus
* A decent looking typography boilerplate with good vertical rhythm
* A solid starting point for creating your own typography styles; it's non-specific and easy to override
* A no-worries, "fine for now" development baseline so you can focus on heavy-lifting, not finessing text


### Presswork is Not

Presswork is not an assertion of perfect text flow. If you dig how it looks, roll with it. If not, style over it or scrap it altogether down the way.

It's also not a full theme or CSS framework. It doesn't include styles for form elements (should it?). It doesn't include a grid. Presswork merely tries to whip text into better shape.
