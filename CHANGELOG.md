# Changes to Simmerplate

---------------------------------

## July 2017

### 0.1.1

* Pivot! This project was called Presswork for about a day ... until I went to publish it on NPM. Turns out there's already a Presswork out there.
* Change the name from Presswork to Simmerplate ... not quite a boilerplate.

### 0.1.0

* Initial commit of the project
    * Extends normalize.css
    * Typography formatting for simple heading tags, paragraphs, and lists
    * Inclusion of a Sans-serif and Serif font version
